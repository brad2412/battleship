## Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

  *  Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to really get into iteration three. We completed iteration two on the evening before the project was due, and only had limited time to even look over iteration three. However, given the lack of an interaction pattern for iteration three, we would have approached it as if we were trying to eat an elephant: one bite at a time. We definitely ran into some trouble throughout iterations one and two when our eyes were too big for our stomachs. Periodically, we had to pull back, remind ourselves to write our tests first, and break things down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Therefore, we would have gone through iteration three by making tests for each feature we were looking to implement, continuing to ask for help as needed, and incrementally working our way forward.

## If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

  *  We would have loved the opportunity to actually play our game! After putting in the number of hours that we did, not getting to play the game is a bit of a let-down. While we know we learned quite a bit simply making it through iterations one and two, it felt like iteration three was where all of that work would finally come together. We talked about how this project was a rewarding one to work on, as we were working together, and actually building something as opposed to simply working our way through an IC. Being able to see that journey out to the end would have been a nice thing to do! 

## Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

  *  We used synchronous dirver-navigator pairing, pretty much exclusively. We talked about the prospect of ping-ponging, and wondered if that might have been a little faster in some ways. However, given how new all this material was to both of us, we wanted to struggle through it together in order to fully understand what it was that we were accomplishing. That way, when we both ended up in a student support session, or with a rock, or with another group, each one of us felt confident speaking to what it was that we were trying to accomplish with each method and test. One group member or another would occasionally look into different ways to acheive a goal after we had signed off for the night, but we would come back for our morning standups to discuss any progress that was or was not made. 

  *  Our morning standup meetings, generally 20 minutes or so in length, were something we both found helpful. We would chat for a bit, and then make a plan for the rest of the day on when we would be meeting for work time, as well as discuss who else we might be meeting with in order to get support on a roadblock we were facing. 

## Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

  *  It felt like there were two differnt places feedback was coming from: 

      * The first was from each other, and would happen during our synchronous driver-navigator sessions. We would provide feedback if someone was missing a character in a line of code that might prove to be an issue, or talk out the logic of a method we had just completed in order to make sure we both understood what it was that had just been accomplished. We would also talk out pseudocode for new methods, and then put it in as a comment when needed. It felt like we were constantly giving each other feedback, which was useful for this project.

      * The second place we got feedback was from the different people we reached out to for support. That included instructors, a rock, a few different groups from our cohort, and two different student support specialists. We would both attend those sessions, and the feedback that we received there was therefore able to be put to use by both of us when we would return to working on the project.
